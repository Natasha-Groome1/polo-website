      "Victoria Pritchard- I can't thank you enough Tash!! This is the first season on my own with full responsibility for running the GBS Service Associates program within our team. The wash up grid had always been a contentious point with my hiring managers. I'd often hear 'takes forever to open' , 'Crashes my laptop' and the regular 'here, you do it' as a manager would thrust a piece of paper at me with their scrawled feedback.    As soon as I saw your wonderful renovation, with it's sublime ease of use, I knew it was a winner for my scheme. I have presented it to my managers and I'm delighted to be using it (with our competencies aligned) for our Virtual Assessment season. So back  my original comment Tash. Thank you!!",

You were a fantastic team player, consistently contributing new ideas in the design process, which was beneficial to the group. I noticed your presentation skills were also of a top level which really helped bring our video to life. It would be great to work with you again!",

      "Anna Withrington- The way you run the Exploration Sessions is very efficient. You book the sessions well in advance which must be great for the candidates and you keep me and the other contributers informed. You check back with me before you make any fundamental changes but you always come with a proposal rather than a problem. It's easy and fun to work with you! You often facilitate the group exercise. You chat with the candidates to make them feel more relaxed and your briefing is very informative and reassuring. During the briefing after the group exercise you provide insightful feedback on the candidates - as good as any of the assessors, and I really value your input.",

      "Christopher Hurren- Thank you for sparing some time to help our community develop Archie. At HowTo we are passionate about our project work and so we are especially grateful to each sponsor user for the impact they have in the development of our Chatbot. I would like to thank you specifically for your the comprehensive feedback you provided on the aesthetics and functionalities of Archie. The points of comparison that you raised between our Watson bot and your JavaScript bot have provided valuable insight to the project. Moving forward we are looking forward to collaboratively implementing these changes with you as an integrated member of our team and eventually delivering an innovative and useful application to Foundation IBMers.

    Paragraph:
      "Emma Page- During your time running and organising the exploration sessions for Apprentices you have showed great organisations skills, time management and great communication skills. When preparing for the ESâ€™s you are all well planned and able to deal with situations as they arise including candidates and assessors cancelling or links not working. During the briefing sessions you put the candidates at ease and communicate the format of the ES in a fun and non-scary format. During the ES Day you are always ready in case of any issues arise including technical difficulties and even wash up grids not working. You have been amazing all year and have excelled in all you have been given and always go the extra mile. The one thing you need to improve on is your own self-belief and you always doubt how good you are when in fact you are more than capable of doing your role plus additional activities on top (as you have shown).",
